Abstract
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims
at automatically predicting missing links for
large-scale knowledge graphs. A vast num-
ber of state-of-the-art KGC techniques have
got published at top conferences in several
research fields, including data mining, ma-
chine learning, and natural language process-
ing. However, we notice that several recent
papers report very high performance, which
largely outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. In this paper, we find that this can be
attributed to the inappropriate evaluation proto-
col used by them and propose a simple evalua-
tion protocol to address this problem. The pro-
posed protocol is robust to handle bias in the
model, which can substantially affect the final
results. We conduct extensive experiments and
report performance of several existing meth-
ods using our protocol. The reproducible code
has been made publicly available.
1 Introduction
Real-world knowledge bases are usually expressed
as multi-relational graphs, which are collections
of factual triplets, where each triplet (h, r, t) rep-
resents a relation r between a head entity h and a
tail entity t. However, real-word knowledge bases
are usually incomplete (Dong et al., 2014), which
motivates the research of automatically predicting
missing links. A popular approach for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC) is to embed entities and
relations into continuous vector or matrix space,
and use a well-designed score function f(h, r, t) to
measure the plausibility of the triplet (h, r, t). Most
of the previous methods use translation distance
based (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Xiao
et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019) and semantic match-
ing based (Nickel and Tresp, 2013; Yang et al.,
2014; Nickel et al., 2016; Trouillon et al., 2016;
∗Equal contribution.
Liu et al., 2017) scoring functions which are easy
to analyze.
However, recently, a vast number of neural
network-based methods have been proposed. They
have complex score functions which utilize black-
box neural networks including Convolutional Neu-
ral Networks (CNNs) (Dettmers et al., 2018;
Nguyen et al., 2018), Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) (Lin et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018),
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Schlichtkrull
et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2019), and Capsule
Networks (Nguyen et al., 2019). While some of
them report state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmark datasets that are competitive to previous
embedding-based approaches, a considerable por-
tion of recent neural network-based papers report
very high performance gains which are not con-
sistent across different datasets. Moreover, most
of these unusual behaviors are not at all analyzed.
Such a pattern has become prominent and is mis-
leading the whole community.
In this paper, we investigate this problem and
find that this is attributed to the inappropriate eval-
uation protocol used by these approaches. We
demonstrate that their evaluation protocol gives
a perfect score to a model that always outputs a
constant irrespective of the input. This has lead to
artificial inflation of performance of several mod-
els. For this, we find a simple evaluation protocol
that creates a fair comparison environment for all
types of score functions. We conduct extensive ex-
periments to re-examine some recent methods and
fairly compare them with existing approaches. The
source code of the paper has been publicly avail-
able at http://github.com/svjan5/kg-reeval.

note the set of entities and relations and T =
{(h, r, t) | h, t ∈ E , r ∈ R} is the set of triplets
(facts), the task of Knowledge Graph Completion
(KGC) involves inferring missing facts based on
the known facts. Most the existing methods de-
fine an embedding for each entity and relation in
G, i.e., eh, er ∀h ∈ E , r ∈ R and a score function
f(h, r, t) : E ×R× E → R which assigns a high
score for valid triplets than the invalid ones.
KGC Evaluation During KGC evaluation, for
predicting t in a given triplet (h, r, t), a KGC
model scores all the triplets in the set T ′ =
{(h, r, t′) | t′ ∈ E}. Based on the score, the model
first sorts all the triplets and subsequently finds the
rank of the valid triplet (h, r, t) in the list. In a
more relaxed setting called filtered setting, all the
known correct triplets (from train, valid, and test
triplets) are removed from T ′ except the one be-
ing evaluated (Bordes et al., 2013). The triplets in
T ′ − {t} are called negative samples.
Related Work Prior to our work, Kadlec et al.
(2017) cast doubt on the claim that performance im-
provement of several models is due to architectural
changes as opposed to hyperparameter tuning or
different training objective. In our work, we raise
similar concerns but through a different angle by
highlighting issues with the evaluation procedure
used by several recent methods. Chandrahas et al.
(2018) analyze the geometry of KG embeddings
and its correlation with task performance while
Nayyeri et al. (2019) examine the effect of differ-
ent loss functions on performance. However, their
analysis is restricted to non-neural approaches.

example valid triplet and its negative samples. The
score is normalized into [0, 1] (lower the better). Dot-

that in this example, around 58.5% negative sampled
triplets obtain the exact same score as the valid triplet.
3 Observations
In this section, we first describe our observations
and concerns and then investigate the reason be-
hind.
3.1 Inconsistent Improvements over
Benchmark Datasets
Several recently proposed methods report high
performance gains on a particular dataset. How-
ever, their performance on another dataset is not
consistently improved. In Table 1, we report
change in MRR score on FB15k-237 (Toutanova
and Chen, 2015) and WN18RR (Dettmers et al.,
2018) datasets with respect to ConvE (Dettmers
et al., 2018) for different methods including RotatE
(Sun et al., 2019), TuckER (Balažević et al., 2019),
ConvKB (Nguyen et al., 2018), CapsE (Nguyen
et al., 2019), KBAT (Nathani et al., 2019), and
TransGate (Yuan et al., 2019). Overall, we find that
for a few recent NN based methods, there are incon-
sistent gains on these two datasets. For instance,
in ConvKB, there is a 21.8% improvement over
ConvE on FB15k-237, but a degradation of 42.3%
on WN18RR, which is surprising given the method
is claimed to be better than ConvE. On the other
hand, methods like RotatE and TuckER give consis-
tent improvement across both benchmark datasets.
3.2 Observations on Score Functions
Score distribution When evaluating KGC meth-
ods, for a given triplet (h, r, t), the ranking of t
given h and r is computed by scoring all the triplets
of form {(h, r, t′) | t′ ∈ E}, where E is the set of

ConvE such occurrences are rare.
all entities. On investing a few recent NN based ap-
proaches, we find that they have unusual score dis-
tribution, where some negatively sampled triplets
have the same score as the valid triplet. An in-
stance of FB15k-237 dataset is presented in Figure
1. Here, out of 14,541 negatively sampled triplets,
8,520 have the exact same score as the valid triplet.
Statistics on the whole dataset In Figure 2, we
report the total number of triplets with the exact
same score over the entire dataset for ConvKB
(Nguyen et al., 2018) and CapsE (Nguyen et al.,
2019) and compare them with ConvE (Dettmers
et al., 2018) which does not suffer from this issue.
We find that both ConvKB and CapsE have multiple
occurrences of such unusual score distribution. On
average, ConvKB and CapsE have 125 and 197
entities with exactly same score as the valid triplet
over the entire evaluation dataset of FB15k-237,
whereas ConvE has around 0.002, which is almost
negligible. In Section 4, we demonstrate how this
leads to massive performance gain for methods like
ConvKB and CapsE.
Root of the problem Further, we investigate the
cause behind such unusual score distribution. In
Figure 3, we plot the ratio of neurons becoming
zero after ReLU activation for the valid triplets vs.
their normalized frequency on FB15k-237 dataset.
The results show that in ConvKB and CapsE, a
large fraction (87.3% and 92.2% respectively) of
the neurons become zeros after applying ReLU

activation. However, with ConvE, this count is
substantially less (around 41.1%). Because of the
zeroing of nearly all neurons (at least 14.2% for
ConvKB and 22.0% for CapsE), the representation
of several triplets become very similar during for-
ward pass and thus leading to obtaining the exact
same score.
4 Evaluation Protocols for KGC
In this section, we present different evaluation pro-
tocols that can be adopted in knowledge graph com-
pletion. We further show that inappropriate evalua-
tion protocol is the key reason behind the unusual
behavior of some recent NN-based methods.
How to deal with the same scores? An essential
aspect of the evaluation method is to decide how
to break ties for triplets with the same score. More
concretely, while scoring the candidate set T ′, if
there are multiple triplets with the same score from
the model, one should decide which triplet to pick.
Assuming that the triplets are sorted in a stable
manner, we design a general evaluation scheme
for KGC, which consists of the following three
different protocols:
• TOP: In this setting, the correct triplet is inserted
in the beginning of T ′.
• BOTTOM: Here, the correct triplet is inserted at
the end of T ′.
• RANDOM: In this, the correct triplet is placed
randomly in T ′.

TOP and BOTTOM, we report changes in performance with respect to RANDOM protocol. Please refer to Section
5.4 for details. †: KBAT has test data leakage in their original implementation, which is fixed in our experiments.
Discussion Based on the definition of the three
evaluation protocols, it is clear that TOP evaluation
protocol does not evaluate the model rigorously. It
gives the models that have a bias to provide the
same score for different triplets, an inappropriate
advantage. On the other hand, BOTTOM evaluation
protocol can be unfair to the model during infer-
ence time because it penalizes the model for giving
the same score to multiple triplets, i.e., if many
triplets have the same score as the correct triple,
the correct triplet gets the least rank possible.
As a result, RANDOM is the best evaluation
technique which is both rigorous and fair to the
model. It is in line with the situation we meet in the
real world: given several same scored candidates,
the only option is to select one of them randomly.
Hence, we propose to use RANDOM evaluation
scheme for all model performance comparisons.
5 Experiments
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments
using our proposed evaluation protocols and make
a fair comparison for several existing methods.
5.1 Datasets
We evaluate the proposed protocols on FB15k-237
(Toutanova and Chen, 2015) dataset1, which is a
subset of FB15k (Bordes et al., 2013) with inverse
relations deleted to prevent direct inference of test
triples from training.
5.2 Methods Analyzed
In our experiments, we categorize existing KGC
methods into the following two categories:
1We also report our results on WN18RR (Dettmers et al.,
2018) dataset in the appendix.
• Non-Affected: This includes methods which
give consistent performance under different eval-
uation protocols. For experiments in this paper,
we consider three such methods – ConvE, Ro-
tatE, and TuckER.
• Affected: This category consists of recently pro-
posed neural-network based methods whose per-
formance is affected by different evaluation pro-
tocols. ConvKB, CapsE, TransGate2, and KBAT
are methods in this category.
5.3 Evaluation Metrics
For all the methods, we use the code and the hyper-
parameters provided by the authors in their respec-
tive papers. Model performance is evaluated by
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR)
and Hits@10 (H@10) on the filtered setting (Bor-
des et al., 2013).
5.4 Evaluation Results
To analyze the effect of different evaluation proto-
cols described in Section 4, we study the perfor-
mance variation of the models listed in Section 5.2.
We study the effect of using TOP and BOTTOM pro-
tocols and compare them to RANDOM protocol. In
their original paper, ConvE, RotatE, and TuckER
use a strategy similar to the proposed RANDOM
protocol, while ConvKB, CapsE, and KBAT use
TOP protocol. We also study the random error in
RANDOM protocol with multiple runs, where we
report the average and standard deviation on 5 runs
with different random seeds. The results are pre-
sented in Tables 2.
2Since we cannot find any open-source implementation
of TransGate, we leave the re-evaluation of TransGate as our
future work.
5520
We observe that for Non-Affected methods like
ConvE, RotatE, and TuckER, the performance re-
mains consistent across different evaluation pro-
tocols. However, with Affected methods, there is
a considerable variation in performance. Specifi-
cally, we can observe that these models perform
best when evaluated using TOP and worst when
evaluated using BOTTOM3. Finally, we find that the
proposed RANDOM protocol is very robust to dif-
ferent random seeds. Although the theoretic upper
and lower bounds of a RANDOM score are TOP and
BOTTOM scores respectively, when we evaluate
knowledge graph completion for real-world large-
scale knowledge graphs, the randomness doesn’t
affect the evaluation results much.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we performed an extensive re-
examination study of recent neural network based
KGC techniques. We find that many such models
have issues with their score functions. Combined
with inappropriate evaluation protocol, such meth-
ods reported inflated performance. Based on our
observations, we propose RANDOM evaluation pro-
tocol that can clearly distinguish between these
affected methods from others. We also strongly
encourage the research community to follow the
RANDOM evaluation protocol for all KGC evalua-
tion purposes.

A Results on WN18RR dataset
Besides FB15k-237, we also evaluate the proposed
protocols on WN18RR (Dettmers et al., 2018)
dataset, which is a subset of WN18 (Bordes et al.,
2013) containing lexical relations between words.
Similar to FB15k-237, inverse relations are re-
moved in WN18RR. The results on WN18RR are
shown in Table 3. From these results, we can draw
similar conclusions as in Section 5. We also show
the total number of triplets with the exact same
score over the entire WN18RR dataset for Con-
vKB, CapsE and ConvE in Figure 4.

dimensional Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) word embeddings for initialization on WN18RR dataset, which makes
the comparison on WN18RR still unfair. †: KBAT has test data leakage in their original implementation, which is
fixed in our experiments.

Figure 4: Plot shows the frequency of the number
of negative triplets with the same assigned score as
the valid triplet during evaluation on WN18RR dataset.
The results show that Unlike FB15k-237, in this dataset,
only ConvKB has a large number of negative triplets
get the same score as the valid triplets.
